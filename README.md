# Data_analyst_task_5

Step 1: Importing Libraries
Imported libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, plotly.express
Purpose: Data manipulation, visualization, and interactive plots.

Step 2: Loading the Data
Loaded the population dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Previewed the first few rows using .head().

Step 3: Data Cleaning
Checked for missing values (.isnull().sum()).
Dropped or handled missing data if necessary.
Ensured column names and data types are correct.

Step 4: Basic Data Exploration
Viewed dataset shape, column types, and basic information (.info(), .describe()).
Identified key columns like:
Country Name
Population
Area
Density
Continent

Step 5: Data Visualization
Created various visualizations to explore the data:
Top 10 Most Populated Countries – Bar plot.
Population Distribution by Continent – Pie chart.
Population vs Area Scatter Plot – To check if a larger area means a larger population.
Population Density Visualization – Bar plots and heatmaps.
Trend Analysis – Line plots if year-wise data is available.

Step 6: Key Insights and Findings
Found which continents have the highest population.
Identified countries with exceptionally high or low density.
Noted the relationship (or lack thereof) between land area and population size.

--- Important Graphs and Charts
Bar charts for top countries
Pie chart for continent-wise distribution
Scatter plots for area vs population
Heatmaps for correlation analysis
Line charts for year-on-year population growth (if included)

--- Conclusion
Summarized key findings regarding world population patterns.
Highlighted anomalies or surprising data points.
Suggested potential further analysis (like time-series forecasting).
